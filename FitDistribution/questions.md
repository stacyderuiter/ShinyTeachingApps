Use the interactive figures (in the *Plots* tab) to practice fitting continuous probability distributions to real datasets.  

One set of plots (labelled "Real Data") shows the data.  The other set of plots ("Simulated Data") shows what you might *expect* the Real Data plots to look like, if the selected distribution really *was* a *perfect* fit to the data.  If the two sets look similar, then the selected distribution is probably a pretty good fit.

There are some questions below to help guide your explorations -- you can try repeating each exercise with several different variables from the Cuvier's beaked whale dataset. 

In your answers, you may want to use vocabulary such as *symmetric* and *skewed* to express your ideas.  

1. To begin with, use the maximum sample size and try fitting some probability distributions to some data distributions.  Can you find a pair where the distribution seems to fit the data really well?  

2. (Still using maximum sample size,) can you find a pair where the distribution is a very poor fit to the data?  What features of the data (or the probability distribution) are causing the mismatch?

3. How do the QQ (quantile-quantile) plots look when a distribution is a good fit to the data?  What about a bad fit?  Can you match any features of 'bad fit' QQ plots back to specific features of the data distribution?

4. How does sample size affect your ability to predict which distribution might be a good fit to a dataset?  Once you've fitted a candidate distribution to the data, how does sample size affect your ability to decide whether a particular distribution fits a dataset well?  (**Hint:** To answer this question, it's best to start with a data variable and probability distribution that definitely fits well for the maximum sample size...then, see how things seem to change as you reduce the sample size.)

5. In general, which features of a probability distribution and a dataset can you use to determine whether the distribution is likely to fit the data well?
