The data presented here are data on Cuvier's beaked whale behaviour.  This dataset includes observations on 277 dives performed by 15 individual blue whales tagged with animal-borne data-loggers called  [DTAGs](http://soundtags.st-andrews.ac.uk/dtags/) during an experiment called the [Southern Californial Behavioural Response Study](http://sea-inc.net/socal-brs/). 

The data were analyzed by DeRuiter and colleagues (2013), and are freely available online in the Dryad digital repository.

The dataset provides measurements of several variables for each dive by each whale. The variables include:

* **Descent (Ascent) Duration** Duration, in minutes, of the descent (ascent) portion of the dive.
* **Relative Ascent Duration** Difference, in hours, between the duration of the ascent and that of the descent (Ascent Duration - Descent Duration).
* **Descent (Ascent) Rate** The vertical speed of the whale during the descent (ascent) portion of the dive.
* **Dive Depth** Maximum depth (in meters) attained by the whale during the current dive.
* **Dive Duration** Duration (in hours) of the current dive.
* **Surface Duration** Duration (in minutes) that the whale spent at the surface after the dive, before beginning the next dive.
* **Average ODBA** Mean Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration during the dive.  This variable provides a relative measure of "how much the whale is moving", or (roughly) how much energy it is using.  
* **Average Fluke Rate** Mean rate at which the animal performs fluke-strokes to swim.  This rate will be greater during very fast swimming.
* **Clicking Duration** Time (in hours) the whale spent producing echolocation clicks during the dive.  The whale produces echolocation clicks while it is actively foraging for food.
* **Proportion Time Clicking** Proportion of the total dive duration during which the whale was producing echolocation clicks.
* **Time Until Echolocation** Time (in hours) from the end of production of clicks during the current dive, until the next initiation of echolocation clicking during any subsequent dive.  During this interval, the whale is probably not feeding at all.
