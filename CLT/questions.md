Use the interactive figures (in the **Plots** tab) to help you explore *Sampling Distributions for the Sample Mean*.  Keep in mind that all of the "data" shown in this app are *simulated*.  Also, it's especially important to keep in mind how we obtained the data to make the plots on the right:

* Take a sample of size *n* from the parent population.
* Compute the sample mean for that sample.
* *Repeat the first two steps **500** times*, so that you have a collection of 500 sample means.
* Make some plots of the distribution of that *collection of 500 sample means*.

Here are some questions to guide your exploration:

1. **Begin with Population 1.**
  *  A. Look at the parent population (the histogram on the left that is filled in green).  How would you describe it (unimodal, skew, uniform...)?  Which, if any, of the probability distributions we've studied do you think would be a good fit?
  *  B. For a small sample size *n*, describe the *distribution of the sample means* (shown in the orange histogram on the right).
How does it change as you increase n?
  * C. What about the spread of the distribution of sample means?  How does it change with *n*? (You might want to experiment: what happens if you double *n*? square *n*? Plot sd as a function of *n*?)
  
  
2. **Now, consider one of the other populations.** (You might want to repeat this question for more than one of them).
    * A. Look at the parent population (the histogram on the left that is filled in green).  How would you describe it (unimodal, skew, uniform...)?  Which, if any, of the probability distributions we've studied do you think would be a good fit?
    * B. **Before you begin to play with the plots, consider:** Do you expect that the patterns you saw above (the distribution and spread of sample means as a function of sample size) will be the same for this distribution?  Why (or why not)?
    * C. For a small sample size *n*, describe the *distribution of the sample means* (shown in the orange histogram on the right).
How does it change as you increase *n*?
    * D. What about the spread of the distribution of sample means?  How does it change with *n*? (You might want to experiment: what happens if you double *n*? square *n*? Plot sd as a function of *n*?)

  
    
    
3. **Can you make any general conclusions based on what you have seen so far?**
  
  
* For later reference, you might want to remember the name of the idea that this app has demonstrated.  It's called the **Central Limit Theorem**.
