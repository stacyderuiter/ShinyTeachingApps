Use the interactive figures (in the *Plots* tab) to get familiar with a few continuous probability density functions (PDFs). Remember that these are just a few of the most commonly used distributions -- there are others not covered in this app.  

Choose one type (normal, exponential, etc.) of probability density function at a time, and try to figure out the answers to the following questions.

1. What is the *support* of the distribution?  The *support* of a probability distribution is the set of possible x-values that the random variable can take on.  The options you might encounter here are:
  - all real numbers
  - all non-negative numbers (greater than zero)
  - all real numbers within some interval

2. Try changing the parameter(s) of the distribution to see what shapes it can take on.  Can it be symmetric?  Left or right skewed?  Any other unusual shapes?  Try to get an idea of how changing each parameter value affects the shape of the distribution.

3. What is the total area under the probability distribution function curve?  How does it change as you change the parameters?

4. Consider the support of the distribution, and the possible shapes it can take on.  Can you think of a kind of dataset whose distribution you think might be well approximated by this kind of PDF?
