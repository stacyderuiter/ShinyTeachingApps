Use the interactive figures (in the *Plots* tab) to get a feel for how numerical summaries of a dataset relate to distribution plots (histograms, density plots, and boxplots) of the data.  

There are some questions below to help guide your explorations. 

In your answers, you may want to use vocabulary such as *unimodal*, *bimodal*, *symmetric*, *skewed*, *uniform*, and *outlier* to express your ideas.

1. When is the mean an accurate measure of the "center" of a distribution? When is it misleading?  For example, sometimes the mean might not match the location of the mode, which is largest "peak" in the distribution.

2. What about the median? When is it (or isn't it) an accurate measure of the "center" of a distribution?

3. Statisticians say that the median is "resistant" to outliers, but the mean and standard deviation are not.  Explain what you think that means.

4. What features of a distribution (unimodal/bimodal/uniform; right-skewed/left-skewed/symmetric; outliers) can you "see" from a boxplot?  What do you look for in the boxplot to diagnose each feature?

5. Which variables have skewed distributions?  Are they right or left skewed? Try to explain in your own words what right and left skew look like.

6. Find a variable whose distribution is skewed.  Explore how skewness is related to the relative values of the mean and median. For example, is there a consistent pattern of mean larger than median (or median larger than mean) depending on whether the skew is right or left?
